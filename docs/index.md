# About me

Data Engineer and IoT/Software Developer with a background in setting up advanced data analytics and IoT platforms in the energy sector and manufacturing industry. Tinkering with home automation, hard- and software, and IoT devices (basically anything that interests me) in my free time. I'm also a big fan of open-source software and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.
