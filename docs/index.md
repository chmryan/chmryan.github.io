# Introduction
Welcome to my docs!

I'm Chris, a Data Engineer and IoT/Software Developer with a background in setting up advanced data analytics platforms and leading the conception, implementation, and optimization of data pipelines & products. Skilled in SQL, Python, and cloud-based technologies, including Azure and some AWS. Tinkering with home automation, hard- and software, and IoT devices (basically anything that interests me) in my free time. I'm also a big fan of open-source software and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.
